# üçã Thanks for visiting Beach House Labs! üçã

Beach House Labs (BHL) is the vision of [Christian Van de Werken](https://werken.com/bio) and is a collection of several small sub-projects - each its own individual AI novelty. The project aims to explore the depths and potential of several public AI/ML innovations while also building some AI-adjacent creations along the way. BHL's bread and butter is building cross-platform / cross-ecosystem integrations and experience handling for AI. 

The project is in active development + not quite ready for the world just yet. Right now, I'm focused on building the first of the toys I have in my BHL roadmap (rights management for AI generated art, Codename Promenade... stay tuned!). For now, you can find the project at its home at [beachhouse.dev](https://beachhouse.dev/) or on Hugging Face at [beach-house-labs](https://huggingface.co/beach-house-labs). For inquiries, please reach out to product@beachhouse.dev.

CVDW 2023-09-04: Quick note - if you came to BHL for the [Beach Please](https://github.com/beach-house-labs/beach-please) repo, I've temporarily made it private. I'm working from two different systems so I need to be able to push commits but I don't want half-baked ideas that don't fully work yet bouncing around in the open. I'll switch that repo back to public once the work is more substantially complete.
